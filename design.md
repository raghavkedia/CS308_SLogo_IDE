The is a graphic display window to display the turtle and its trajectory, a console to type command, a history box to display past command, a variable box to display variables that has been defined.

A user control the turtle by typing SLogo commands in console. When the “RUN” button on GUI is clicked, the current command on console is executed.

We might make turtle a dragable object, so user can drag the turtle to a certain position.

The console window will also report error whenever user’s command has type error or execution error. These errors are detected by the back-end, which will pass error messages to the front-end to be displayed.
